Mux Breakout Board

Guide to using the blue version of this board with an Arduino Uno:  
Four Uno digital output pins are used to select 16 sources that are read by one Uno analog input.  
There is no latching shift register on this board for holding values.

**Note that the board label misspells "Analog" as "Anaing";  
users need to confirm that signal names match the schematic and actual board layout)**
